Taking advantage of logistic regression, the goal of this project is to locate segments
of text from input document and classify them in one of the pre-defined categories(e.g., 
PERSON, LOCATION and ORGNIZATION). In this project, we only perform NER for a single
category of TITLE. We define a TITLE as an appellation associated with a person by virtue
of occupation, office, birth or as an honorific. For example, in the following sentence,
both Prime Minister and MP are TITLES:
			Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull MP visited Germany yesterday.
